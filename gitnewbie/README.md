This is the readme for git and github commands for use in Whonix.

Using git on GitHub:
* https://guides.github.com/ - guides
* https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/ - important commands to use to manage a repo

Tutorial resources:
* https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/
go to this section " Example: Start a new repository and publish it to GitHub "
- even if you don't start a new repo, these commands are useful!

Unrelated:
* This README becomes a bit modified now so that I can solve the puzzle of what "Changes not staged for commit: modified:   wikidata/wikidata-resources.txt" means. I'm assuming it means that if I commit, the new changes won't be incorporated into the push(I think its called push, oh nvm)
* So if everything works as it should line 1-10 should be pushed to my github repo. If not, I misinterpreted everything
