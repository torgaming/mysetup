These are the Travian git commands I use to fetch the latest software of TravianZ to experiment with from mainly https://github.com/iopietro/TravianZ/ and mods and minor changes to gameplay and other media.

This file is part of the introductory steps for git and github commands to make TravianZ run before this month(July 2019) runs out, hackint IRC network time. I did the following to set it up:
- I went into my s directory("dir"). I mkdir travianziopetro(pointless, as gonna be seen later...)
- cd into that dir then I do this command:
* git clone https://github.com/iopietro/Travianz.git
- it created a dir called Travianz. After I did ls, it shows me only Travianz dir, no .git dir(that was my mistake in this process, the .git is inside the Travianz dir)
- I rename the Travianz dir to something else
* mv Travianz/ travianziopietro
- I then rename it again(yeah, don't ask)
* mv travianziopietro/ travianzWHOiopietro/
- done, now time to move it so I do
* mv travianzWHOiopietro/ ..
- ...and that places this dir into the original s dir where I should have done the git clone commands in the first place instead of running around pointlessly like the process you just witnessed.
- nothing left in this dir
* cd ..
- we're back in the main dir
* rm travianziopetro/
- didn't work, I need a recursive flag(needed for directories I think!)
* rm -r travianziopetro/
- deleted, ok cool. Let's move inside the dir we made such a big fuss about
* cd travianzWHOiopietro/
* ls .git
- ls .git was just to be sure there's a .git dir inside the original "Travianz" dir. Yes there was, confirmed.

Let's get down to business cause this was a bunch of superfluous stuff already...
- obviously, we have already "anchored in" the clone, so now we have a fresh git repo to get working. Git pull will fetch all new updates(if there are any) so in case my server doesn't run for sane or dumb reasons I can always get the latest version and try again.
* git pull
- did what I think it would have done

When I compile I copy the directory into a new one and compile from there. If I somehow fail after doing git pull and I mess stuff up, I might just delete the dir with rm -r trashittravianzWHOiopietro:
* cp -r travianzWHOiopietro/ trashittravianzWHOiopietro
- worked fine. If I get many working copies and do different stuff with them then I just create extra directories ie.
- cp -r travianzWHOiopietro/ trashittravianzWHOiopietro2
- cp -r travianzWHOiopietro/ trashittravianzWHOiopietro3
- cp -r travianzWHOiopietro/ trashittravianzWHOiopietrochangedb
