* git status - check changes done in the repo
* git diff - check what has changed

* git branch - kinda useless command for now, check what branch I am on, usually master.

# git status - related
#
# if git status gives information about untracked files, add the entire directory and all
# files in the directory and subdirectories should be added too...I think...maybe.
# Adding new directories inside the mysetup "home dir", separate files or removing files which git have detected were deleted:
* git add nameofdirectory
* git add nameofanotherdirectory
* git add nameofdirectory3
* git add nameoffile.c
* git rm thisfilewaserased-or-renamed.c

* git commit -m "add README to initial commit" - important command that takes a snapshot and let's us prepare a commit before it gets committed/pushed to our main repository.
* git push - asks for github username and password (it remembers the github repo I'm pushing to though)
