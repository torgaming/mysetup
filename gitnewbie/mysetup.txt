This file was mainly written for the mysetup github project which this file is part of.

* git status - check changes done in the repo
- git log is used for many purposes, in this case to supply us with examples to use for the git diff command
* git log - puts you in 'read git log' mode. Exit with q
* git diff - check what has changed
- git diff if you run it alone it will not give a result as you noticed already with the above command
* git diff 16cab288d2da5311d83f6d3251ef30f03f8a2185 65309c76b917caf119eb280e5ffc95072fb42245 - checking git log we got ourselves 2 checksums. They will most likely look different in your setups...naturally.

* git branch - kinda useless command for now, check what branch I am on, usually master.

# git status - related
#
# if git status gives information about untracked files, add the entire directory and all
# files in the directory and subdirectories should be added too...I think...maybe.
# Adding new directories inside the mysetup "home dir", separate files or removing files which git have detected were deleted:
* git add nameofdirectory
* git add nameofanotherdirectory
* git add nameofdirectory3
* git add nameoffile.c
* git rm thisfilewaserased-or-renamed.c
- or just add everything with
* git add .
- you've added all files without having to select each one separately. Kinda practical.

* git commit -m "add README to initial commit" - important command that takes a snapshot and let's us prepare a commit before it gets committed/pushed to our main repository.
* git push - uploads changes to the repository. Asks for github username and password (it remembers the github repo I'm pushing to though)
- through this process it also lets us know to which git repo it is uploading the changes to
