This is the file with "less useful" git help.
This is what happens when you got a draft file, are done with it, and then decide to keep it anyway:

- git help everyday ### run everyday guide which is actually helpful! ###
- git log #history of commits

basic commands for an initialized git repository:
- git help -a #list all commands
- git help -g #list git guides
