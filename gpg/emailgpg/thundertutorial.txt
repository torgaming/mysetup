This tutorial will guide us through creating a new email address to setting up thunderbird with enigmail 
heavily inspired by this documentation: 
http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Encrypted_Email_with_Thunderbird_and_Enigmail
but the information at http://danielas3rtn54uwmofdo3x2bsdifr47huasnmbgqzfrec5ubupvtpid.onion/mail/index.php is also
necessary to configure thunderbird correctly.

- We start by making a new email address at 
- http://danielas3rtn54uwmofdo3x2bsdifr47huasnmbgqzfrec5ubupvtpid.onion/mail/postfixadmin/register.php
- Choose a username and a password. If you can't think of a username use tutorial and add a number to it
- ie. try with tutorial1, if that's not available try tutorial2 etc.
- The password can be generated with KeePassX or a similar program. Best done locally, I assume.
- Now that you've chosen a username and a password. I chose "tutorial" as username and by good luck
- it seems that username was not taken. I let KeePassX generate a 64 character password for me as
- well. 

TUTORIAL IS PAUSED SECTION

Skip this section if you don't like to read "stupid text":
- "I have read and agreed to the Privacy Policy" must be checked to continue. Whether you read
- the actual Privacy Policy or you don't is fully up to you. It is quicker to do this tutorial if
- you don't read it. If you had to choose between reading the Privacy Policy and reading this tutorial
- I'd recommend 1000/1000 times to read this tutorial, I don't want my readers to be delayed.
- You can read the Privacy Policy when you have completed my tutorial. I believe agreeing with the
- Privacy Policy is sufficient, reading it is secondary. But hey that's my opinion, if you really feel
- the right thing is to actually read it before you finish my superb tutorial then go ahead.
- But then again you won't get a diamond star from me for not reading it but only agreeing with it.
- You will have to feel content with only a gold star. Though maybe gold is better than diamond, who knows?

Skip this section if you don't like to read "stupid text 2":
- Thank you for resisting the temptation of reading the above "stupid text". 
- You have now earned an ".onion transport star".
- An ".onion transport star" is by far the greatest prize you'll ever receive from me for completing this
tutorial...
- ...which has not been written yet, still a work in progress, sorry about that.

TUTORIAL CONTINUES SECTION
- Now that you have successfully registered an email account you should get a message:
"The mailbox tutorial@tt3j2x4k5ycaa5zt.onion has been added to the mailbox table."
- Congratulations! You now have an email address!
- We are still in Whonix and we are gonna install thunderbird
* sudo apt-get install thunderbird
- install thunderbird like that or use a gui like ie. synaptic, your choice.
- Time to install enigmail
* sudo apt-get install enigmail
- again install enigmail like that or use a gui like ie. synaptic, again your choice.

- WORK IN PROGRESS
