- I have a routine for git, which mostly involves git add and various files, git -m commit "my message here" and git push.
- This file is for creating a daily routine for gpg and the web of trust. Its evolution will continue adding more commands but for now we'll import the same key for each practice session.

* cd ~/Downloads/keys
- This is our working directory("dir")
- We create a new dir for an archive of supposedly old keys.
* mkdir archivedkeys

simple:
* check folder "archivedkeys" to see what I should rename old patrick.asc file to.
* download same key over and over using wget http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/patrick.asc
* import it into the key database
* see if the key has changed. In either case there's no other action, practice finished!

routine idea:
* cd ~/Downloads/keys
* ls archivedkeys/
- to see which keys already exist to avoid name collisions.
* mv patrick.asc patrick2.asc
- or mv patrick.asc patrick3.asc dependent on new keys which are being downloaded.
* mv patrick.asc archivedkeys/
- will put the file with current file name as is in that dir. mv patrick2.asc archivedkeys/ etc. as time goes on
* wget http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/patrick.asc
* gpg --import patrick.asc
