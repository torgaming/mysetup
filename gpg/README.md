You can skip this section entirely and enter the directory gpgexercises but also be informed that the gpg directory also will now host information about how to setup 
email accounts and programs that are used in relation to gpg. There are exercises there that should help you learn by doing how to enter the 
gpg/pgp web of trust in a permanent way. Master all exercises(work in progress!) and you'll become a web of trust master for all eternity!
If you don't want to yet just continue reading and have a good time! When you are done do what I already suggested.

In the past I knew how to use a graphical gpg program in Whonix, but now all this knowledge is practically gone, because it was so long ago and not documented or linked to in a dependable way.
Also I didn't have a system in which I will preserve the knowledge. This time I'm planning for a 'learn by doing' system in which each user of this greater guide will learn how to permanently enter the web of trust.

This exists as a resource for anybody who's using a recent version of Whonix and for them to feel welcome and find the tools to join the web of trust:

1. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key#Web_of_Trust
2. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust

Starting off with gpg we may realize that we don't have any keys at all, we might start off empty unless some keys have been downloaded. As I start off in my version of Whonix I got no keys so I enter the directory gpgexercises and begin my journey into the web of trust!
