In the past I knew how to use a graphical gpg program in Whonix, but now all this knowledge is practically gone, because it was so long ago and not documented or linked to in a dependable way.
Also I didn't have a system in which I will preserve the knowledge. This time I'm planning for a 'learn by doing' system in which each user of this greater guide will learn how to permanently enter the web of trust.

This exists as a resource for anybody who's using a recent version of Whonix and for them to feel welcome and find the tools to join the web of trust(not the "fake" or "pretend wot" ones that got little or no cryptography technology as a basis for the web-of-trust system)

Starting off with gpg we may realize that we don't have any keys at all, we might start off empty unless some keys have been downloaded. As I start off in my version of Whonix I got no keys so I start with a list of options of available gpg keys:
* http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion/contact.php
- put the PGP key in a file like example.asc
* touch example.asc
* kwrite example.asc
- then copy and paste the file
