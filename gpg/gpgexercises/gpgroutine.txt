As explained in the diary there's a 'not well thought out' gpg routine. This file is for making it more clear what the routine actually is. 
This should be a web of trust routine and part of the problem why its not defined yet is because I lack some knowledge necessary.
I'd go as far as resetting the entirety of the .gnupg settings directory for each routine(group of exercises)

Preparation. The preparation section isn't part of the routine.
It is what should be done once, and once you've done it one time, don't do it again.
So let's begin:
* cd ~/d/mysetup/gpg/gpgexercises
* less WARNINGresetweboftrust.txt
- now that we've done this let's do more in preparation

* mkdir ~/d/gitraining
* cd ~/d/gitraining
* git clone https://github.com/torgaming/mysetup.git
* cd mysetup/gpg/gpgexercises
* git pull
- it should say Already up-to-date.

- work in progress. My motivation is dwindling, I'll try to do something that is gpg
related and continue this guide when I'm more motivated.

gpg routine(do these in order):
* WARNINGresetweboftrust.txt
*
