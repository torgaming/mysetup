Carles Tubio Terr√≥n hosts or is the contact for the .onion v2 transport http://gnjtzu5c2lv4zasv.onion/ which is a working
key server. It works with gpg when refreshing keys or downloading new keys.

- compare http://archivecaslytosk.onion/tVdjI with https://ca.rles-tub.io./terr%C3%B3n to see if they got the same PGP key.
- Assuming you used Tor Browser, you still have the PGP key in your clipboard, then paste the contents of the clipboard into
- a file called example.asc.
* touch example.asc
- open example.asc with an editor of your choice.
- paste the contents of your clipboard(if it has not been cleared) into example.asc. Save the file.
* gpg --import example.asc
* rm example.asc
- guess we are done. Key should be imported now and removed. Well done!
