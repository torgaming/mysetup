This is a gpg import beginning exercise while learning the basics of the web of trust.

simple:
- In this example I download patrick.asc(a public PGP key) which belongs to 
- one of the main developers who work for the Whonix project.
* wget http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/patrick.asc
- import it into the key database
* gpg --import patrick.asc
- You can run this command on the same key over and over. This way if the key changes in the future, gpg --import key.asc will tell you if the key has changed when it compares it to the existing one in your web of trust database.
* rm patrick.asc
- so that when I upload this documentation the key won't go along these docs to the repo.
