-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- 
look at this file to learn how to
put a PGP key you read in a web browser
into an putnamehere.asc file that
later gets imported with
gpg --import notafakekey.asc.
If you import this key into gpg
it is going to give an error.
Though other keys which have lots
of "PGP code" in them are gonna
most probably be imported just fine
