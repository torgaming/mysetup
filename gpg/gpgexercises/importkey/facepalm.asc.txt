This is a gpg import beginning exercise while learning the basics of the web of trust.

This is a bad example of the web of trust since this is a key that supposedly hasn't been signed that much. 
The basic idea of the web of trust is to import keys that have been signed by others or making sure that others 
in your community sign your key and that somebody else has signed their keys that will hopefully connect with a 
future stranger who belongs to an interconnected gpg web of trust network.

- I need to find a better example of a PGP key.
- Maybe Carles Tubio Terr√≥n's PGP key http://archivecaslytosk.onion/tVdjI
- I've actually now made a new file called carlestubiokeyimport.txt

- visit http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion/contact.php
* touch example.asc
- we create a file to store the PGP key in
* kwrite example.asc
- then copy and paste the PGP key inside the example.asc file
* gpg --import example.asc
- You are done with your first gpg key import but let's delete the key so it doesn't get pushed to the main repo
* rm example.asc
- Done!
