Depends: You need to have at least one key that has been imported into your web of trust. 
For this exercise I recommend to do at least importakey.txt. If you do importakey.txt or if you have already imported a key with gpg --import yourkeynamehere.asc you can continue
with this exercise.

- this command will update all keys in your web of trust using gnjtzu5c2lv4zasv.onion as a keyserver.
* gpg --refresh-keys --keyserver gnjtzu5c2lv4zasv.onion
- the results of the command tells you later how many keys were processed and how many of them weren't
- updated.
