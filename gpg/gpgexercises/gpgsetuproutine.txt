This file was made for the purpose of creating a routine specifically
to configure gpg. Thus we learn how to train on setting up gpg.
Examples include resetting the entirety of gpg and the settings
associated with it, setting a default keyserver etc. A default
keyserver might be already set up on some systems. So this file
is about setting up configuration settings and options for gpg.
