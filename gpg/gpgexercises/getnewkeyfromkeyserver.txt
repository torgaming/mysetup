Welcome to this exercise. Here we get a key from an existing keyserver:

* gpg --keyserver hkp://gnjtzu5c2lv4zasv.onion --recv-keys 0x63fee659
- this command asks for a Tor developer's key. This key should be
- replaced in the future so we choose a key for a party whose
- identity we don't know yet.
