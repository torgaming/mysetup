WARNING. USING THIS SECTION RESETS YOUR ENTIRE WEB OF TRUST. THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN'T REBUILD IT IF YOU DO CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THROUGH. 
I'D RECOMMEND YOU DO THIS FOR TRAINING PURPOSES. IF YOU GOT A COMPLEX NETWORK OF TRUST THAT IS HARD TO REBUILD EXIT THIS FILE NOW.
THESE INSTRUCTIONS DO NOT ACTUALLY DELETE ANYTHING. YOU SIMPLY BACKUP YOUR PREVIOUS SETTINGS, BUT STILL PRACTICALLY IT COUNTS AS A RESET.

- go to your home directory
* cd ~
- this enters your home directory. Now we will rename .gnupg to something else.
* mv .gnupg reset.gnupg
- We renamed .gnupg now to to reset.gnupg so we are gonna try
- a gpg command so it generates a basic directory for gpg:
* gpg --list-keys
gpg: directory '/home/whonix/.gnupg' created
gpg: keybox '/home/whonix/.gnupg/pubring.kbx' created
gpg: /home/whonix/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
- Ok. we are done! gpg has now been RESET
