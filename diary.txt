after a chat on an .onion IRC network I was inspired to start daily git activity, in order for some git commands to stick so I don't forget them in 1-2 months forward in the future. So I type something every day and

what happened. I chatted on an .onion IRC network and got inspired to start this diary.

Friday July 19 2019 -- 18:42:33 +00:00
just another comment

work on challenge. I'm not seeking help until it's the "last day of the loser" July 31, but honestly this is hard.

spending 15m on this to learn how to run php code.
- sidetracked which web server am I already running?
- found it.

21:26:10 +00:00
spending another 15m learn how to run php code
- /var/www
Ok, I've learnt about micro-httpd.

Sunday July 21 2019 -- 17:00:40 +00:00, hackint time
Gonna spend 1h to follow this guide to run micro-httpd http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Onion_Services#Tor_Onion_Services_-_EASY
If I need less time I'll let you know
#standard diary commit
What I'm gonna do is set micro-httpd to port 85 instead of 80.
- What might complicate things is that I'm already running lighttpd at port 80 and micro-httpd might want to host stuff on the same port until I configure it.
--No, lighttpd works maybe because micro-httpd didn't automatically turn itself on.
#above committed: 1 hour spent trying to figure out micro-httpd

20:05:46 +00:00
What happened was that I didn't set micro-httpd to port 85 cause I don't know how to do that yet but this will be explored later.

Spending time to learn the gpg web of trust and documenting live. 1 hour
To learn all gpg commands that are necessary for a healthy web of trust by heart I'm setting in motion the file dailywotpractice.txt (can be accessed from mysetup/gpg/dailywotpractice.txt dir)

Probably nothing changed but I got this message today. gpg: key 0x8D66066A2EEACCDA: "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" not changed
and I'm done 21:00:02 +00:00

I feel uninspired but can still work something out...
gpg next, I did my first commit today. Now I've done my gpg too. 

17 minutes spent working on Travian, thus spent working on micro-httpd
doing 'man micro-httpd' worked fine. Should have thought of that before I spent these 17 minutes.

Now I'm working a longer 1 hour and 54 minutes to solve once and for all, all the commands I need to make micro-httpd run at all, and to learn if it can run php 7 code.
micro-httpd runs using inet. What's inet? The man page mentions /etc/inetd.conf but it hasn't been created yet.
* sudo kwrite /etc/services
- Anyway I was half way through solving some of the issues I have.

Tuesday July 23 2019 -- 19:07:09 +00:00
Feel even more uninspired, but I feel I have the power to do great things! What a paradox! :)

Wednesday July 24 2019 -- 02:48:04 +00:00
Turned out I didn't do anything. Oh well, all days can't be productive.

Thursday July 25 2019 -- 17:41:11 +00:00
Keep the practice up!
gpg key once again not changed...

Friday July 26 2019 -- 18:42:46 +00:00
#adding all newest changes so that I can commit them and give them a commit message if I want(I usually do). diary.txt is the file and then I add all changes that were made inside the directory game_research.
git add diary.txt game_research/

Saturday July 27 2019 -- 20:00:04 +00:00
Today I take on improving my gpg practice guide. Importing a key is one thing, but doing something more I think is in order. We'll see what we learn...
We should there were 

Saturday August 3 2019 -- 13:42:41 +00:00
Obviously I uploaded a key to my repo. That wasn't supposed to happen, I was supposed to delete it. Will deal with that now

Tuesday August 6 2019 -- 23:17:40 +00:00
Learning and documenting how to use email with an .onion v3 emailing service in a practical sense.

Wednesday August 7 2019 -- 03:35:14 +00:00
Added a gpg subsection about thunderbird and related information. Mostly links for now
- I also want to add that I'm going to try to setup thunderbird with torbirdy from scratch
- each day so that I can exercise the process it takes to do it. The goal is to learn this
- by heart so I won't need instructions in the future. Nonetheless I will document the process
- so that others and possibly a future myself can benefit from them.

so in short. I got my git routine, gpg routine is kinda not well thought-out yet and then a new thunderbird
routine.
The gpg routine can be improved by offering an alternative to waiting for a keyserver to respond. 
This keyserver gnjtzu5c2lv4zasv.onion isn't always good at responding so exporting my keys
with gpg --export --armor --output keys.asc would work. That file is large, I doubt it is suitable for
a pastebin.

At some point I ran this command
* gpgconf --list-options gpg
Might be useful. Who knows. I might need it some day!

Thursday August 8 2019 -- 02:05:51 +00:00
I'm done with bothering with gpg any more right now. I'll move on to the
thunderbird email tutorial for now.
