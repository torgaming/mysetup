after a chat on an .onion IRC network I was inspired to start daily git activity, in order for some git commands to stick so I don't forget them in 1-2 months forward in the future. So I type something every day and

what happened. I chatted on an .onion IRC network and got inspired to start this diary.

work on challenge. I'm not seeking help until it's the "last day of the loser" July 31, but honestly this is hard.

spending 15m on this to learn how to run php code.
- sidetracked which web server am I already running?
- found it.

spending another 15m learn how to run php code
- /var/www
Ok, I've learnt about micro-httpd.

Sunday July 21 2019 -- 17:00:40 +00:00, hackint time
Gonna spend 1h to follow this guide to run micro-httpd http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Onion_Services#Tor_Onion_Services_-_EASY
If I need less time I'll let you know
#standard diary commit
What I'm gonna do is set micro-httpd to port 85 instead of 80.
- What might complicate things is that I'm already running lighttpd at port 80 and micro-httpd might want to host stuff on the same port until I configure it.
--No, lighttpd works maybe because micro-httpd didn't automatically turn itself on.
#above committed: 1 hour spent trying to figure out micro-httpd

What happened was that I didn't set micro-httpd to port 85 cause I don't know how to do that yet but this will be explored later.

Spending time to learn the gpg web of trust and documenting live. 1 hour
To learn all gpg commands that are necessary for a healthy web of trust by heart I'm setting in motion the file dailywotpractice.txt (can be accessed from mysetup/gpg/dailywotpractice.txt dir)

Probably nothing changed but I got this message today. gpg: key 0x8D66066A2EEACCDA: "Patrick Schleizer <adrelanos@riseup.net>" not changed
and I'm done 21:00:02 +00:00

I feel uninspired but can still work something out...
gpg next, I did my first commit today. Now I've done my gpg too. 

17 minutes spent working on Travian, thus spent working on micro-httpd
doing 'man micro-httpd' worked fine. Should have thought of that before I spent these 17 minutes.

Now I'm working a longer 1 hour and 54 minutes to solve once and for all, all the commands I need to make micro-httpd run at all, and to learn if it can run php 7 code.
micro-httpd runs using inet. What's inet? The man page mentions /etc/inetd.conf but it hasn't been created yet.
* sudo kwrite /etc/services
- Anyway I was half way through solving some of the issues I have.
